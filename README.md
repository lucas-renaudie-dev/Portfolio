# Portfolio

Welcome to my Git Portfolio!

My name is Lucas Renaudie, I am 21 years old and I speak both English and French completely fluently. 
I have just graduated from McGill University - B.A. Computer Science Major, Mathematics Minor.

Recently, I have discovered a passion for 3D art and computer graphics. 
I have started applying to Masters in these fields, and I am also currently taking an 150-hour intensive Blender course, at Les Gobelins (Paris), as I would like to start working on my own 3D projects independently.

Here, you’ll find a selection of my projects, all inspired by academic and self-taught experiences.

You can also take a look at my CV (Resume):&nbsp; [English Version](Lucas_Renaudie_CV_English.docx)&nbsp; |&nbsp; [French Version](Lucas_Renaudie_CV_Français.pdf)
