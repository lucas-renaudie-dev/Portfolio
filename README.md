# Portfolio

Welcome to my Git Portfolio!

My name is Lucas Renaudie, I am 22 years old and I am fully fluent in English and French.

I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at McGill University (Montreal, Canada).
Throughout my degree, I developed solid programming skills across multiple languages, including Java, Python, and C++. 
In math, my studies covered advanced algebra and calculus, differential equations, probability, graph theory and logic.

Currently, I am pursuing further studies at ATI Université Paris 8, focusing on Maya, Unreal Engine (virtual production, animation), Unity, Houdini, GLSL programming, and pipeline development. 

In parallel, I completed a 150-hour Blender course at Les Gobelins (Paris), which I continue to use for personal projects, especially for environment creation and renders. 

Here, you’ll find a selection of my projects, reflecting both academic work and independent learning.
