# Portfolio

Welcome to my Git Portfolio!

My name is Lucas Renaudie, I am 21 years old and I speak both English and French completely fluently. 
I have just graduated from McGill University, obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics

Recently, I have immersed myself in the world of 3D art, computer graphics and game development. I have started applying to Masters in these fields, and I also completed a 150-hour intensive Blender course at Les Gobelins (Paris), in order to start working on my own 3D projects independently. I aim to blend technical, artistic and scientific expertise, in order to adress complex technical challenges in the animation and video-game industry.

Here, you’ll find a selection of my projects, all inspired by academic and self-taught experiences.
